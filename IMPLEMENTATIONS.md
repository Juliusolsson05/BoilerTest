Ideas for Additional Functionalities

Ideas for Additional Functionalities
====================================

1.  **Multiple Classes Support:** Extend the script to handle multiple classes within a single Python file, allowing generation of test files for each class.
2.  **Methods Outside Class:** Enhance the script to support methods defined outside of classes, ensuring that test cases can be generated for these methods as well.
3.  **Check for Test Folder:** Implement a check for the existence of the test folder before writing the test files, creating it if necessary to maintain a structured project setup.
4.  **Parameterized Test Case Generation:** Introduce the capability to generate parameterized test cases, allowing stubs with arguments similar to the original methods to be created.
5.  **Support for Class Variables:** Add support for initializing class variables in the test class, ensuring comprehensive testing coverage for methods dependent on these variables.
6.  **Detecting Inheritance:** Implement logic to detect and handle inheritance in classes, enabling appropriate test generation and consideration of inherited methods.
7.  **Extraction of Docstrings:** Extract docstrings from methods and include them as comments in the test functions, providing valuable context for understanding the purpose and expected behavior of the tests.
8.  **Test Coverage Report:** Develop a feature to generate a comprehensive report indicating the percentage of methods being tested and identifying untested methods, aiding in assessing the overall testing coverage.
9.  **Support for Test Libraries:** Consider incorporating support for generating tests compatible with popular test libraries such as `pytest` or `nose`, catering to different testing preferences and frameworks.
10.  **Integration with Version Control Systems:** Explore the possibility of integrating the script with version control systems like Git, automating the process of committing the generated test files to a repository for better project organization and tracking.
