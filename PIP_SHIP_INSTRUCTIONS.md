Creating an Installable Python Library

Creating an Installable Python Library
======================================

Follow these steps to create a Python package that can be installed with pip:

1. **Organize your code:** Organize your code with the following structure:

    your\_package/
    |-- your\_package/
    |   |-- \_\_init\_\_.py
    |   |-- your\_module.py
    |-- setup.py
    |-- README.md
    |-- LICENSE

2. **Write a setup.py file:** Create a `setup.py` file with the necessary metadata:

    from setuptools import setup, find\_packages

    setup(
        name="your-package",
        version="0.1",
        packages=find\_packages(),
        description="A brief description of your package",
        author="Your Name",
        author\_email="<your.email@example.com>",
        url="<https://github.com/yourusername/your-package>",
        license="MIT",
        install\_requires=\[
            # List of dependencies
        \],
    )

3. **Generate a distribution package:** Run the following command in the terminal:

python setup.py sdist bdist\_wheel

4. **Upload the distribution package to PyPI:** Install `twine` and run the following command:

    pip install twine
    twine upload dist/\*

Make sure to replace placeholders with your own information. After completing these steps, your package will be available on PyPI and can be installed using `pip install your-package`.
